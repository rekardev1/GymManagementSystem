# Gym Management System
A system to gym owners to manage and automate their daily tasks. This project was my groups graduation project at last year in Sulaimani Polytechnic University (SPU).

# Setting Up Development Environment
After cloned the project, take these steps to setup development environment:
1. Publish the Data SQL database project to your SQL instance with any name you prefer.
2. Get the connection string of the published database and put it in the connection string section in App.config in GSMUI project.
3. Set the GSMUI project as startup project.
4. Run the project and use name 'Admin' and password '12345' as default user to log in to the program and start exploring it.
